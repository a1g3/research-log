### DNS Scanner
I worked on submitting the Travel Grant for ICNP 2023.  I finished the personal letter today and updated my CV.

I sent a draft proposal to Rockwell's AT team about a possible collaboration on some networking research.

### TA-Bot
Today I worked on setting up docker-ized TA-Bot.  There were some complexities trying to configure SELinux, however, we eventually figured it out.  Perviously, TA-Bot was installed on the host machine, which was a headache to setup.  By docker-izing TA-Bot, we hope it makes it easier for instructors to deploy and update.  There are still some code cleanup changes that we must make to TA-Bot before its public release in December.  We need to standardize the API calls between the frontend and backend.  Additionally, the code needs unit tests.
