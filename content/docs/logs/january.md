### DNS Measurement
I presented my poster of my current work at the Marquette International Privacy Day Event. It went really well!  I got good questions on my feedback and future directions I can look into. I’m going to issue an update to the scanner for the February scan. By then I hope to scan from three geographical locations. 

### TA-Bot
Jack and I worked finished our presentation for the virtual SIGCSE participants over the weekend. We’re going to have Dr. Brylow review it before we submit it tomorrow. The next step is to design the poster. I plan to begin this upcoming weekend.

### Compilers
I met with the compilers group today to integrate the translator phase into our MiniJava compiler.  We spent most of the time cleaning up our Bash script that we use to compare our implementation to Dr. Brylow's implementation.  On Wednesday, we plan on discussing garbage collection before implementing the final phase of our compiler.

### DNS Measurement
I talked with Dr. Perouli about the current state of the project and future directions.  I might use it as a research project in the Advanced Computer Security class.  I finished my poster today for the Privacy and Security Student Research Showcase at Marquette.  I hope to have it printed by tomorrow.

### TA-Bot
Jack and I worked on our SIGCSE poster video for the online participants.  We've completed the slides and plan on recording the video tomorrow.
